# Ultimate Wallpaper Changer


This is a GNOME extension to change wallpapers from local and online providers.
This repository is a fork of **Jomik/gnome-wallpaper-changer**, but updated, with some fixes and new image providers.

### Notes:
For use Wallhaven provider is recommending to create your own Wallhaven account, then in your account settings you must get your API key and put it in the extension settings. Or you can use mine: **McHvJ0o8nkxes4gNccXWn3RbgPST5vl5**
